Some spiders change colors to blend into their environment. It's a defense mechanism.
Who wouldn't?
I have a father. His name was Ben Parker.
Let mom and dad talk gobby
With great power, comes great responsibility.
Staying away from you. That's a cute outfit, did your husband get it for you?
J. Jonah Jameson: Who is Spider-man? He's a criminal that's who he is.
What about my uncle? Did you give him a chance? Did you? Did you!?
You know who I am.
Your friendly neighbourhood Spiderman! *Swings off*
Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man!
The great thing about MJ is when you look in her eyes and she's looking back in yours, everything feels not quite normal. Because you feel stronger and weaker at the same time. You feel excited and at the same time, terrified. The truth is you don't know what you feel except you know what kind of man you want to be. It's as if you've reached the unreachable and you weren't ready for it.
Who am I? I'm Spider-Man!
It's you who's out, Gobbie. Out of your mind.
Who am i? I'm Spider-Man
Its you who's out gobby out of mind.
Oh, great.
Staying away from you. That's a cute outfit. Did your husband give it to you?
I had a father, his name was Ben Parker.
What about Ben Parker? Did you give him a chance?
Whatever life holds in store for me, I will never forget these words: "With great power, comes great responsibility." This is my gift, my curse. Who am I? I'm Spiderman.
